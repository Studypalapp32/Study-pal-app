"What is the primary difference between skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle cells?","Skeletal muscle cells are uninucleated, while cardiac muscle cells are multinucleated.","Skeletal muscle cells are voluntary, while cardiac muscle cells are involuntary.","Skeletal muscle cells lack striations, while cardiac muscle cells are striated.","Skeletal muscle cells are found in hollow organs, while cardiac muscle cells are not.",B
"Which of the following sequences correctly lists the layers of the epidermis from deep to superficial?","Stratum corneum, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, stratum basale.","Stratum basale, stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, stratum corneum.","Stratum basale, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum corneum.","Stratum corneum, stratum spinosum, stratum granulosum, stratum basale.",C
"According to the sliding filament theory of muscle contraction, what is the role of calcium and ATP?","Calcium initiates the contraction, while ATP is only needed for relaxation.","Calcium binds to myosin, while ATP binds to actin to facilitate contraction.","Calcium exposes binding sites on actin, while ATP provides energy for the myosin cross-bridge cycle.","Calcium and ATP work together to directly slide the filaments without molecular interactions.",C
"Which of the following statements about the neuromuscular junction is FALSE?","It involves the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.","It requires specialized receptors on the muscle cell membrane.","It can function without the presence of acetylcholine.","It is the site where neuronal input triggers muscle contraction.",C
"What is the primary function of the Z-lines in myofibrils?","They produce ATP for muscle contraction.","They serve as attachment points for adjacent thin filaments.","They store calcium ions for muscle contraction.","They generate action potentials in muscle cells.",B
"Which of the following correctly describes a key difference between the dermis and hypodermis?","The dermis is vascular, while the hypodermis is non-vascular.","The dermis is composed of loose connective tissue, while the hypodermis is dense connective tissue.","The dermis facilitates skin movement, while the hypodermis provides mechanical protection.","The dermis contains stratified squamous epithelium, while the hypodermis contains adipose tissue.",A
"In the context of muscle attachments, which statement correctly defines 'insertion'?","The tendinous attachment that moves the least during contraction.","The bony structure that serves as the primary anchor for the muscle.","The tendinous attachment that moves the most during contraction.","The point where nerves innervate the muscle fibers.",C
"Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of smooth muscle cells?","They are uninucleated.","They are voluntary.","They are found in the walls of hollow organs.","They are involved in peristalsis.",B
"What is the primary physiological significance of the skin's highly absorptive property?","It allows for efficient uptake of topically applied medications.","It facilitates rapid nutrient absorption from the environment.","It enables the skin to act as a primary respiratory organ.","It makes the skin the main site for water retention in the body.",A
